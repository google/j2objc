# 20% Project Ideas

While J2ObjC is quickly maturing, there is still more features developers would like to see. There are several such projects that are small and self-contained, perfect for engineers interested in learning about translators or want to contribute in some way. If you'd like to help, please read through and accept the [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual), then read on!

### Translation Enhancements

- **Optimized code**: j2objc's translations tend to be semantically correct (adhere's to the Java source's design), but often can be better written from an Objective-C perspective. Any time you see translated code and think, "I'd write it this way," consider contributing an optimization.

### Other Libraries

- **[JOGL (Java for OpenGL)](https://github.com/sgothel/jogl)**: The JOGL project already has a [macosx port](https://github.com/sgothel/jogl/tree/master/src/jogl/native/macosx). The OSX-specific code is small, so it should be feasible to port it to iOS using j2objc, especially since it's actively used on Android.
- **[JSON](http://json.org/)**: there are several JSON libraries in Java, so picking one that is fast, small, and aligns well with iOS would be useful.

- **[Apache HttpCore](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/)**, **[Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/)**

### Sample iOS Apps

There is a relatively steep learning curve for using j2objc, so simple apps that demonstrate how it can be integrated with iOS apps will help.
