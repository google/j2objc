/**
 * <p>A Service provides access to service objects that implement a
 * particular service, e.g. transliterators.  Users provide a String
 * id (for example, a locale string) to the service, and get back an
 * object for that id.  Service objects can be any kind of object.
 * The service object is cached and returned for later queries, so
 * generally it should not be mutable, or the caller should clone the
 * object before modifying it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Services 'canonicalize' the query id and use the canonical id to
 * query for the service.  The service also defines a mechanism to
 * 'fallback' the id multiple times.  Clients can optionally request
 * the actual id that was matched by a query when they use an id to
 * retrieve a service object.</p>
 *
 * <p>Service objects are instantiated by Factory objects registered with
 * the service.  The service queries each Factory in turn, from most recently
 * registered to earliest registered, until one returns a service object.
 * If none responds with a service object, a fallback id is generated,
 * and the process repeats until a service object is returned or until
 * the id has no further fallbacks.</p>
 *
 * <p>Factories can be dynamically registered and unregistered with the
 * service.  When registered, a Factory is installed at the head of
 * the factory list, and so gets 'first crack' at any keys or fallback
 * keys.  When unregistered, it is removed from the service and can no
 * longer be located through it.  Service objects generated by this
 * factory and held by the client are unaffected.</p>
 *
 * <p>ICUService uses Keys to query factories and perform
 * fallback.  The Key defines the canonical form of the id, and
 * implements the fallback strategy.  Custom Keys can be defined that
 * parse complex IDs into components that Factories can more easily
 * use.  The Key can cache the results of this parsing to save
 * repeated effort.  ICUService provides convenience APIs that
 * take Strings and generate default Keys for use in querying.</p>
 *
 * <p>ICUService provides API to get the list of ids publicly
 * supported by the service (although queries aren't restricted to
 * this list).  This list contains only 'simple' IDs, and not fully
 * unique ids.  Factories are associated with each simple ID and
 * the responsible factory can also return a human-readable localized
 * version of the simple ID, for use in user interfaces.  ICUService
 * can also provide a sorted collection of the all the localized visible
 * ids.</p>
 *
 * <p>ICUService implements ICUNotifier, so that clients can register
 * to receive notification when factories are added or removed from
 * the service.  ICUService provides a default EventListener subinterface,
 * ServiceListener, which can be registered with the service.  When
 * the service changes, the ServiceListener's serviceChanged method
 * is called, with the service as the only argument.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ICUService API is both rich and generic, and it is expected
 * that most implementations will statically 'wrap' ICUService to
 * present a more appropriate API-- for example, to declare the type
 * of the objects returned from get, to limit the factories that can
 * be registered with the service, or to define their own listener
 * interface with a custom callback method.  They might also customize
 * ICUService by overriding it, for example, to customize the Key and
 * fallback strategy.  ICULocaleService is a customized service that
 * uses Locale names as ids and uses Keys that implement the standard
 * resource bundle fallback strategy.<p>
 * @hide Only a subset of ICU is exposed in Android
