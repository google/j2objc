/**
 * Data and functions for the FCD check fast path.
 *
 * The fast path looks at a pair of 16-bit code units and checks
 * whether there is an FCD boundary between them;
 * there is if the first unit has a trailing ccc=0 (!hasTccc(first))
 * or the second unit has a leading ccc=0 (!hasLccc(second)),
 * or both.
 * When the fast path finds a possible non-boundary,
 * then the FCD check slow path looks at the actual sequence of FCD values.
 *
 * This is a pure optimization.
 * The fast path must at least find all possible non-boundaries.
 * If the fast path is too pessimistic, it costs performance.
 *
 * For a pair of BMP characters, the fast path tests are precise (1 bit per character).
 *
 * For a supplementary code point, the two units are its lead and trail surrogates.
 * We set hasTccc(lead)=true if any of its 1024 associated supplementary code points
 * has lccc!=0 or tccc!=0.
 * We set hasLccc(trail)=true for all trail surrogates.
 * As a result, we leave the fast path if the lead surrogate might start a
 * supplementary code point that is not FCD-inert.
 * (So the fast path need not detect that there is a surrogate pair,
 * nor look ahead to the next full code point.)
 *
 * hasLccc(lead)=true if any of its 1024 associated supplementary code points
 * has lccc!=0, for fast boundary checking between BMP & supplementary.
 *
 * hasTccc(trail)=false:
 * It should only be tested for unpaired trail surrogates which are FCD-inert.
 * @hide Only a subset of ICU is exposed in Android
