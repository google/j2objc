/**
 * A buffered character-input stream that keeps track of line numbers.  This
 * class defines methods {@link #setLineNumber(int)} and {@link
 * #getLineNumber()} for setting and getting the current line number
 * respectively.
 *
 * <p> By default, line numbering begins at 0. This number increments at every
 * <a href="#lt">line terminator</a> as the data is read, and can be changed
 * with a call to {@code setLineNumber(int)}.  Note however, that
 * {@code setLineNumber(int)} does not actually change the current position in
 * the stream; it only changes the value that will be returned by
 * {@code getLineNumber()}.
 *
 * <p> A line is considered to be <a id="lt">terminated</a> by any one of a
 * line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed
 * immediately by a linefeed.
