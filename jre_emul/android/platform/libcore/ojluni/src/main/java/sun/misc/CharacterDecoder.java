/**
 * This class defines the decoding half of character encoders.
 * A character decoder is an algorithim for transforming 8 bit
 * binary data that has been encoded into text by a character
 * encoder, back into original binary form.
 *
 * The character encoders, in general, have been structured
 * around a central theme that binary data can be encoded into
 * text that has the form:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      [Buffer Prefix]
 *      [Line Prefix][encoded data atoms][Line Suffix]
 *      [Buffer Suffix]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Of course in the simplest encoding schemes, the buffer has no
 * distinct prefix of suffix, however all have some fixed relationship
 * between the text in an 'atom' and the binary data itself.
 *
 * In the CharacterEncoder and CharacterDecoder classes, one complete
 * chunk of data is referred to as a <i>buffer</i>. Encoded buffers
 * are all text, and decoded buffers (sometimes just referred to as
 * buffers) are binary octets.
 *
 * To create a custom decoder, you must, at a minimum,  overide three
 * abstract methods in this class.
 * <DL>
 * <DD>bytesPerAtom which tells the decoder how many bytes to
 * expect from decodeAtom
 * <DD>decodeAtom which decodes the bytes sent to it as text.
 * <DD>bytesPerLine which tells the encoder the maximum number of
 * bytes per line.
 * </DL>
 *
 * In general, the character decoders return error in the form of a
 * CEFormatException. The syntax of the detail string is
 * <pre>
 *      DecoderClassName: Error message.
 * </pre>
 *
 * Several useful decoders have already been written and are
 * referenced in the See Also list below.
