/**
 * The mapping in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> programming language
 * for the SQL <code>CLOB</code> type.
 * An SQL <code>CLOB</code> is a built-in type
 * that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of
 * a database table.
 * By default drivers implement a <code>Clob</code> object using an SQL
 * <code>locator(CLOB)</code>, which means that a <code>Clob</code> object
 * contains a logical pointer to the SQL <code>CLOB</code> data rather than
 * the data itself. A <code>Clob</code> object is valid for the duration
 * of the transaction in which it was created.
 * <P>The <code>Clob</code> interface provides methods for getting the
 * length of an SQL <code>CLOB</code> (Character Large Object) value,
 * for materializing a <code>CLOB</code> value on the client, and for
 * searching for a substring or <code>CLOB</code> object within a
 * <code>CLOB</code> value.
 * Methods in the interfaces {@link ResultSet},
 * {@link CallableStatement}, and {@link PreparedStatement}, such as
 * <code>getClob</code> and <code>setClob</code> allow a programmer to
 * access an SQL <code>CLOB</code> value.  In addition, this interface
 * has methods for updating a <code>CLOB</code> value.
 * <p>
 * All methods on the <code>Clob</code> interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
