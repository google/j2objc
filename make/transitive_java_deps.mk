# Template for determining the list of transitive dependencies for a set of java
# source files. As a side-effect of determining the dependencies a jar of the
# compiled java sources is produced.
#
# The including makefile may define these variables:
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_NAME
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_ROOT_SOURCES
#     - List of relative java sources.
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_SOURCEPATH
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_DEPENDENCIES
#     - Concrete targets that should force re-generation.
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_JAVAC_ARGS
#
# The following variables will be defined by this include:
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_FULL_SOURCES
#     - Relative list of all java files depended on by the root sources.
#   TRANSITIVE_JAVA_DEPS_JAR
#     - The .jar file that is produced.
#
# The including makefile may also add dependent order-only targets by adding
# requirements to the "transitive_java_deps_dependencies" target.
